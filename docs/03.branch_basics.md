# 03. git branch

The below diagram visualizes a repository with two isolated lines of development, one for a little feature, and 
one for a longer-running feature. By developing them in branches, it’s **not only possible to work on both of them 
in parallel**, but it also **keeps the main branch free from questionable code**.


A branch represents an independent line of development. **Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit 
process**. You can think of them as a way to request a brand-new working directory, staging area, and project history. 
New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.

The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn’t let you switch between branches 
or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with 
**the git checkout and git merge commands**.

# 3.1 Check existing branch

```shell
git branch
```

# 3.2 Create a new branch
To create a branch, you can use below command.
```shell
git branch <branch_name>
```

For example

```shell
git branch dev

# switch to dev branch
git checkout dev 
# similar to above command
git switch dev
```

Or you can use 

```shell
# this will create the branch and switch to it automatically
git checkout -b <new_branch>

# this will create the branch and switch to it automatically just like above command
git switch -c <new_branch>
```

For example, we can use below command to create a new branch and switch to it

```shell
git switch -c feature/branch_management

# output
# Switched to a new branch 'feature/branch_management'

```

## 3.3 Merge branch

We can merge branch if we want to add the code of one branch to another

You can use below command:
```shell
git merge <name>

```

For example, go to branch dev, add a file and merge it.

```shell
git checkout dev

```

create a file test/dev.txt. add some text in it. Now merge branch to main branch
Now you are in dev branch, try to run below command
```shell
git merge main
```
The output is **Already up to date.** And nothing happens.

Let's try another way 

```shell
git checkout main
git merge dev
```

This time, the output is like below, and you can notice the file dev.txt is created in your working directory of branch 
main

```shell
Updating 284dfd2..91ca029
Fast-forward
 test/dev.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 test/dev.txt

```

This happens because git merge only merge the give branch to current branch, if current branch is ahead of the given
branch, it means there is nothing new in the given branch that the current branch does not have. so it does nothing.

If the given branch is ahead of the current branch, git will bring all new changes to current branch.

## 3.4 Switching branch

Note, when you switch branch, you may see below message

```text
git checkout feature/branch_management 
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
        docs/03.branch.md
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting

```

Git protects your work

## 3.5 push to remote branch

So far all the branch management work is done on your local pc. You can also push them to remote sever

```shell
git push <remote-name> <branchname>
```

For example 

```shell
# switch to branch
git checkout feature/branch_management
# push the branch to remote server
git push origin feature/branch_management
```

You should see below output. git create a new branch in remote server

```text
Enumerating objects: 6, done.
Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 401 bytes | 401.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 4 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:
remote:   git@github.com:pengfei99/hello-github.git
remote: 
remote: Create a pull request for 'feature/branch_management' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/pengfei99/hello-github/pull/new/feature/branch_management
remote: 
To github.com:pengfei99/hello-github-actions.git
 * [new branch]      feature/branch_management -> feature/branch_management

```

And with the GUI of github.com, you can do merge directly in the remote server.


## 3.6 Delete branch

After merge, you can delete a branch

```shell
git branch -d <name>
```

For example, to delete local branch

```shell
git branch -d feature/branch_management
```

Since we have pushed this branch to a remote server, we need to remove it from remote server too.

View all branches remote and local
```shell
git branch -a 
```
You should see below output

```text
* main
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/feature/branch_management
  remotes/origin/main

```

The remote branch name such as **remotes/origin/feature/branch_management** :
- remotes : indicate it's a branch on remote server
- origin : indicate the remote server name
- feature/branch_management: is the branch name

To delete this remote branch, we need to do

```shell
git push origin --delete feature/branch_management
```

You should see below output

```text
remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:
remote:   git@github.com:pengfei99/hello-github.git
To github.com:pengfei99/hello-github-actions.git
 - [deleted]         feature/branch_management

```

## 3.7 Resolve conflict with Fast forward merge

Fast forward merge can be performed when there is a direct linear path from the source branch to the target branch. 
In fast-forward merge, git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an 
extra merge commit.


When we make change on the same file at two branch, if you want to merge them together, you need to resolve conflict

For example, 

Create a new branch
```shell
git checkout -b feature/conflict
```

Add below line to test/doc1.txt, and commit it

```text
This line is updated in feature/conflict branch
```

Now, switch to main branch, you can notice the above line is not in file test/doc1.txt, add below line to the file
and commit the change.
```text
This line is updated in main branch
```

Now merge the conflict branch to current branch.

```shell
git merge feature/conflict 

```

The output looks like this.

```text
Auto-merging test/doc1.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in test/doc1.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Git tells us that the conflict can't be handled the conflict automatically, so we need to fix conflicts first. 

You can open the file test/doc1.txt, you will see below text

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
This line is updated in main branch
=======
This line is updated in feature/conflict branch
>>>>>>> feature/conflict
```

Git use below general form to help us to fix confict
```text

<<<<<<< HEAD
<content of the current branch that causes confilct>
=======
<content of the merged branch that causes confilct>
>>>>>>> <merge branch name>
```

We need to decide how we want to keep the content. Here we decide we will take the both branch name in the.
The final content looks like :

```text
This line is updated in main branch and feature/conflict branch
```

Add the modification, you need to commit the change

```shell
git add test/doc1.txt
git commit -m "fix confict"

# to view the merge history, you can use below command
git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
```

You should see below output

```text
*   3bee4e2 (HEAD -> main) fix confict
|\  
| * 6866020 (feature/conflict) update conflict branch
* | aee95f3 update in main branch
|/  
* ccf04da (origin/main, origin/HEAD) finish  branch
*   fe637dd Merge branch 'main' of github.com:pengfei99/hello-github-actions into main
|\  

```

And we can delete the branch

```shell
git branch -d feature/conflict 

# Deleted branch feature/conflict (was 6866020).

```

## Merge without Fast-forward 

If we want to diable Fast forward, we can use **--no-ff** option when we call merge. 

Check below example
```shell
# create a branch dev
git switch -c dev

# add below line to file test/doc1.txt
for no fast word.

# commit the change
git add test/doc1.txt 
git commit -m "test for merge without fastforward"

# go back to main branch
git checkout main

# merge the dev branch to main without fast forward
# here we need to use -m to give a commit comment, because merge without fast forward will create a new commit
git merge --no-ff -m "merge with no-ff" dev
```

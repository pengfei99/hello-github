# 1 Git basics

## 1.1 Setup git

Go to the project folder that you want to do version control with git, and do below command

```shell
git init
```

This will create **.git** directory in your project, all the information that help you to do version control will be 
located here.

## 1.2 Create a commit

Create a file called test/doc1.txt, and put below text in it 
```text
hello this is my first commit
```

Then commit a new version. Each time you call commit, a new version will be created.
```shell
# track the changes of this file
git add test/doc1.txt

# commit a version
git commit -m "add doc1.txt version1"
```

Now change the file, add below line. Then commit the changes again

``` text
update to version 2
```

```shell
# track the changes of this file
git add test/doc1.txt

# commit a version
git commit -m "update doc1.txt to version2"
```

## 1.3 Go back/forward to a version

Now we have two versions of a file, suppose we have made some mistakes in version 2, and we want to go back to version 1.

We first need to know which version is available

```shell
git log 

```
you should see below outputs. it has all the information of every version that you have committed.
- commit id : unique identifier of a commit
- Author : 
- Date
- Description
```text
commit 02e34c31ac224bac5f6753883c12b0013daff00a (HEAD -> main)
Author: Pengfei Liu <liu.pengfei@hotmail.fr>
Date:   Thu Mar 24 19:39:18 2022 +0100

    update doc1.txt to version2

commit d8d70adfa1490fdc5824b47d75cb8c3d9cf51fea
Author: Pengfei Liu <liu.pengfei@hotmail.fr>
Date:   Thu Mar 24 19:38:41 2022 +0100

    add doc1.txt version1

```

If you want information more compact, you can all a oneline log

```shell
git log --pretty=oneline

```
You should see this:

```text
02e34c31ac224bac5f6753883c12b0013daff00a (HEAD -> main) update doc1.txt to version2
d8d70adfa1490fdc5824b47d75cb8c3d9cf51fea add doc1.txt version1
```

If you have a visualization tool, you can view the commit are line up as a timeline based on the commit time. You can
notice that **the last commit has (HEAD -> main)** which means this commit is the head (most recent) commit of branch
main. We will talk about branch later. Now lets just go back to version 1. Run below command:

```shell
# this command means set head of this branch to the version before last version 
git reset --hard HEAD^
```

After running this command, you can notice **in file doc1.txt, the line 'update to version 2' has been removed**. It means
we are going back to version 1. And the below log confirms it. We don't have the version 2 in the timeline.  

```shell
$ git log --pretty=oneline
d8d70adfa1490fdc5824b47d75cb8c3d9cf51fea (HEAD -> main) add doc1.txt version1

```

Now suppose I regret, I want to restore version2. Don't worry, nothing is lost, you can still get it back, all you need
to do is **get the commit id of version 2**. If your terminal is not closed, you can easily get the commit id of version 2.

Now suppose you closed your terminal, you can still get it via below command:

```shell
# git track all user's action, you can get your action history with below command
git reflog
```

You should see below output:
```shell
d8d70ad (HEAD -> main) HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD^
02e34c3 HEAD@{1}: commit: update doc1.txt to version2
d8d70ad (HEAD -> main) HEAD@{2}: commit: add doc1.txt version1
```
We can get the commit id of version 2 is "02e34c3". Note it's not the complete version id, but don't worry git will 
autocomplete it for you.

Let's rerun 

```shell
git reset --hard d8d70ad
```

Now the verion 2 is back, you can confirm it from the log

```shell
$ git log --pretty=oneline
02e34c31ac224bac5f6753883c12b0013daff00a (HEAD -> main) update doc1.txt to version2
d8d70adfa1490fdc5824b47d75cb8c3d9cf51fea add doc1.txt version1

```

There are two ways to set head 
1. Use relative HEAD indicator: HEAD^ means the 1st version before head. HEAD^^ means the 2nd version before head. For 
                                the 100st version before head, you can write HEAD~100.

2. Use commit id: git reset --hard d8d70ad 

## 1.4 Staging area

When you create a version of your project in git, it has two steps:
1. Add changes from working directory to staging area (i.e. git add)
2. Commit all the changes of staging area to the current branch (i.e. git commit)

Below figure shows an example

Let's create a 3rd version, and review the process.

Add below line to 'doc1.txt'

```text
update to version 3
```

Then run below command

```shell
# This shows the current status of your project file tracking 
git status
```

You should see 
```text
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   test/doc1.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .idea/
        docs/

```

Now run:

```shell
git add test/doc1.txt
git status
```

Now you should see:

```text
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   test/doc1.txt

```

Now run:

```shell
git commit -m "update test/doc1.txt to version 3"
```

You should see
```text
On branch main

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## 1.5 Revert changes

Git allows you to revert the changes, and go back to initial stat (last commit)

### 1.5.1 Changes is in working directory 

Suppose you write something wrong in the doc1.txt file, and you want to go back to the version. If the changes are not
added to the staging  area (no git add). You can do the following

```shell
git checkout -- <file-name>
```

For example, add a line in file test/doc1.txt. 

Then run 
```shell
git checkout -- test/doc1.txt
```

You will notice, the line that you just add is removed


### 1.5.2 Changes in staging area

If you already did `git add`, it means the changes is already in the staging area. git checkout will not work, because
it will restore the latest version that stored in the staging area. So we need to reset head of the staging area, this
will un-stage the last change.

For example, add a line in file test/doc1.txt. Then run 
```shell
# add change to staging area
git add test/doc1.txt

# check your git status
git status
```

You should see below output

```text
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   test/doc1.txt

```


So now, we need to unstage the change. You can use the below two commands to unstage. They do the same thing

```shell
# option 1 
git restore --staged test/doc1.txt

# option 2
git reset HEAD test/doc1.txt
```

Even though we unstage the changes from the staging area. But the changes is still in the file. So we need to call
below command to remove the changes
```shell
git checkout -- test/doc1.txt
```

## 1.6 Monitor the changes

Git tracks changes in a file, not the file. A change could be adding a new file, adding a line or deleting a line in a 
file. 

Add below line to test/doc1.txt

```text
update to version 4
```

and commit the change

```shell
git add test/doc1.txt

git commit -m "update to version 4"
```

now add another line

```text
update to version 5
```

try to commit without add

```shell
git commit -m "update to version 4"
```

You should see below output

```text

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   test/doc1.txt


no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

This happens because, we did not add the change of the working directory to the staging area. And commit has nothing to
commit to the current branch.

We can check **the difference between the working directory and the current branch** by using below command

```shell
git diff HEAD -- test/doc1.txt 
```

We can also compare diff between two commits. For example, below commands show the diff between last commit and the one
before.
```shell
git diff HEAD^ HEAD
```

Although it gives you all the information, but it's hard to read when the diff is important. We will show you tools that
can help you visualize the diff easily in later section.

## 1.7 Remove a file

Creat a new file "test/tmp.txt". And commit it to your current branch.

```shell
git add test/tmp.txt 
git commit -m "add tmp file"
```
To delete the file, 

In working directory

```shell
# in working directory
rm test/tmp.txt 
```

If you want to restore it, you can call

```shell
git checkout -- test/tmp.txt
```

This works, because this file is tracked and commit to the current branch. 

To delete the file in git, you can use below command. Note **you must commit after this, otherwise it will not work**

```shell
# delete file
git rm test/tmp.txt

git commit -m "remove test/tmp.txt"
[main 7ddaedb] remove test/tmp.txt
 1 file changed, 2 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 test/tmp.txt
```

This time when you call
```shell
git checkout -- test/tmp.txt

# You should see this output
error: pathspec 'test/tmp.txt' did not match any file(s) known to git
```

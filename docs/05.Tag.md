# 5. Tags

**Tags are references showing particular points in a Git history. The main function of tagging is to capture a point in 
a Git history that marks version release.** Tags don’t change. After a tag is created, it has no history of commits.

## 5.1 Creating a tag

In order to create a git tag you need to run the command below:

```shell
git tag <name-of-tag>
```

While the tag is being created put a semantic identifier to the state of the repository instead of <name-of-tag>. 
There are two kinds of tags that are supported by Git
- annotated tags: it has more metadata, and the tag is public
- lightweight tags. it has less metadata, and the tag is private.

### 5.1.1 Annotated tags

Git database store these tags as full objects. Some additional metadata are stored in annotated tags. These can be 
the tagger name, email, and date. Annotated tags include a tagging message, as it is in case of commits. They can 
be additionally signed and verified with GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) for security purposes.


```shell
git tag -a v0.0.1 -m "This is my first release"
```

The -m flag is followed by the tagging message you want to include. If you don’t include this flag, Git will launch 
your code editor for you to include it.

### 5.1.2 Lightweight tags

The command below creates a lightweight tag identified as v0.1-lw. They are created **without the -a, -s, or -m options**. 
Lightweight tags generate a new tag checksum stored it in the .git/ directory.

```shell
git tag v0.1-lw
```

## 5.2 show tags
Run the code below to list the stored tags:


```shell
git tag
```

You can use the -l option with a wildcard expression to clear up the list of tags:

```shell
git tag -l *-lw*
```

To view more details of a tag, you can use 

```shell
git show <tag-name>
```

for example, if you run below command,

```shell
git show v0.0.1
```

You should see output like this:
```text
tag v0.0.1
Tagger: Pengfei Liu <liu.pengfei@hotmail.fr>
Date:   Sun Mar 27 13:56:17 2022 +0200

This is my first release

commit fb0c8005334c4de218279c06101a3ae8c6807113 (HEAD -> main, tag: v0.1-lw, tag: v0.0.1, origin/main, origin/HEAD)
Author: Pengfei Liu <liu.pengfei@hotmail.fr>
Date:   Sun Mar 27 13:07:28 2022 +0200

    finish rebase

```
## 5.3 Tagging old commit

By default, **git tag creates a tag on the commit mentioned by HEAD**. It can be passed as a ref to a particular 
commit. As a result, the passed commit will be tagged instead of defaulting to HEAD. Run the git log command to output 
a list of older commits. You need to get the commit id of the commit that you want to tag. 

For example, in below git log, I want to tag the commit "Add files via upload".

```shell
git log --pretty=oneline 

fb0c8005334c4de218279c06101a3ae8c6807113 (HEAD -> main, tag: v0.1-lw, tag: v0.0.1, origin/main, origin/HEAD) finish rebase
70d64d5f1cc3c2874040797dff343b95bc47f587 Merge branch 'main' of github.com:pengfei99/hello-github-actions into main
a8bd279087febdf01e8783f3959b869243998ed4 update rebase doc
83a70802bf0e2f458769b537f0b98a6631e2e423 Add files via upload
e35a528c93219a25b19f7bc1bca6b00bafd02982 Merge branch 'main' of github.com:pengfei99/hello-github-actions into main

```

I will run below command:

```shell
git tag -a v0.0.2 83a70802bf0e2f458769b537f0b98a6631e2e423 -m "my second release on commit Add files via upload"
```

You can view the newly created tag

```shell
git show v0.0.2
tag v0.0.2
Tagger: Pengfei Liu <liu.pengfei@hotmail.fr>
Date:   Sun Mar 27 14:09:53 2022 +0200

my second release on commit Add files via upload

commit 83a70802bf0e2f458769b537f0b98a6631e2e423 (tag: v0.0.2)
Author: pengfei liu <liu.pengfei@hotmail.fr>
Date:   Sun Mar 27 12:58:30 2022 +0200

    Add files via upload

```

## 5.4 Replacing old tags

In the case of trying to tag an older commit with an existing tag identifier, an error will occur. You should use 
-f FORCE option for updating an existing tag. It will cancel any existing content for the tag identifier.

For example, we will tag the second merge with tag v0.0.1

```shell
git tag -a -f v0.0.1 e35a528c93219a25b19f7bc1bca6b00bafd02982
```

Note you can modify old tag comments too at the same time. 

Now checked the replaced tag

```shell
git show v0.0.1

tag v0.0.1
Tagger: Pengfei Liu <liu.pengfei@hotmail.fr>
Date:   Sun Mar 27 14:17:48 2022 +0200

This is my first release
after merge remote

commit e35a528c93219a25b19f7bc1bca6b00bafd02982 (tag: v0.0.1)
Merge: 4d25160 ed69005
Author: Pengfei Liu <liu.pengfei@hotmail.fr>
Date:   Sun Mar 27 12:36:13 2022 +0200

    Merge branch 'main' of github.com:pengfei99/hello-github-actions into main

```

## 5.5 Pushing tags to remote


In order to push several tags together, you should pass the --tags option to git push command, and if another user 
clones a repository, they will get the new tags.

```shell
# push one tag
git push <remote-name> <tag-name>

git push <remote-name> --tags
```

For example, we want to push tag v0.0.1

```shell
git push origin v0.0.1

To github.com:pengfei99/hello-github-actions.git
 * [new tag]         v0.0.1 -> v0.0.1

```

If want to push all tags

```shell
git push origin --tags

Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.

remote:   git@github.com:pengfei99/hello-github.git
To github.com:pengfei99/hello-github-actions.git
 * [new tag]         v0.0.2 -> v0.0.2
 * [new tag]         v0.1-lw -> v0.1-lw
```

## 5.6 Checking over tags

With the help of the git checkout command, you can check the state of a repo. **This command will put the repo in a 
separate HEAD state. As a result, instead of updating the tag, the changes will create a new separate commit, which 
will not be a part of any branch. This commit will only be accessible by the SHA hash.**

```shell
git checkout v0.0.1

Note: switching to 'v0.0.1'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at e35a528 Merge branch 'main' of github.com:pengfei99/hello-github-actions into main

```

## 5.7 Deleting tags

### Delete local tag
**You can delete a local tag bypassing the -d option and a tag identifier to the git tag**. 
You can find an example of this operation below:

```shell
git tag -d v0.1-lw

Deleted tag 'v0.1-lw' (was fb0c800)

```

### Delete a remote tag

To delete a remote tag, you need to run below command

```shell
git push --delete <remote_name> <tag_name>
```
For example, we can delete tag v0.1-lw in remote server with below command


```shell
git push --delete origin v0.1-lw

remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:
remote:   git@github.com:pengfei99/hello-github.git
To github.com:pengfei99/hello-github-actions.git
 - [deleted]         v0.1-lw

```
